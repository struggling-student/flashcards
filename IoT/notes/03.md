# IoT Devices and Embedded Systems

## What are Embedded Systems in IoT?
Embedded systems are computerized systems highly specialized for a specific application, performing few tasks efficiently. Unlike general-purpose computers, IoT devices like smart thermostats and smart light bulbs are embedded systems enhanced with internet connectivity to communicate and interact over networks.

## How is the architecture of a high-level Embedded System organized?
A high-level embedded system typically consists of a microcontroller at its core, interfaced with input devices (sensors, buttons), output devices (actuators, displays), and communication interfaces. These components work together to sense, compute, act, and communicate.

## What is the difference between Microcontrollers (MCUs) and Microprocessors?
Microcontrollers integrate CPU, RAM, ROM, timers, and I/O ports into a single chip, optimized for low power and cost. Microprocessors, instead, focus only on computation, needing external peripherals, resulting in higher power and performance but greater complexity and cost.

## What is the difference between a Microcontroller and a System-on-Chip (SoC)?
While microcontrollers bundle basic peripherals and a processor on one chip, SoCs include more advanced subsystems like digital signal processors, multiple CPUs, and wireless communication modules, aiming for higher complexity and more features at the cost of higher power consumption.

## What is the CPU structure in an embedded system?
The CPU typically contains an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), registers for quick data access, and a Control Unit to coordinate operations. It interacts with memory and peripherals through a system bus composed of data, address, and control buses.

## What are the main types of CPU Instruction Set Architectures (ISA)?
- **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing)**: Many complex instructions; fewer instructions needed per program but more cycles per instruction (e.g., Intel x86).
- **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)**: Fewer, simpler instructions; more instructions per program but faster execution (e.g., ARM Cortex-M, Atmel AVR).

## What are common communication buses used in embedded systems?
- **I2C**: Two-wire bus (clock and data) for short-distance, low-speed communication with multiple peripherals.
- **UART**: Simple asynchronous communication using separate transmit and receive lines.
- **SPI**: Fast, synchronous communication using master-slave architecture with separate lines for data and clock.

## What are EEPROM, Flash Memory, and NVRAM?
- **EEPROM**: Electrically erasable, allows data writing and erasure byte-by-byte.
- **Flash Memory**: Erased in blocks, commonly used in modern devices for its balance of cost, speed, and durability.
- **NVRAM**: Combines RAM with battery backup, retaining data even when power is off.

## What are Parallel and Serial I/O ports?
- **Parallel I/O**: Transfer multiple bits simultaneously over several wires—fast but impractical over long distances.
- **Serial I/O**: Transfer data bit-by-bit over a single line—slower but more reliable and suitable for longer distances.

## What is an ADC and a DAC?
- **ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)**: Converts analog signals (like sound or light intensity) into digital form.
- **DAC (Digital to Analog Converter)**: Converts digital data into analog signals to control real-world devices like motors or audio outputs.

## What are Cortex-M Microcontrollers?
Cortex-M is a family of 32-bit microcontrollers designed for embedded systems, categorized into:
- **ARMv6-M**: Cortex-M0, M0+, M1 (lowest power, smallest)
- **ARMv7-M**: Cortex-M3
- **ARMv7E-M**: Cortex-M4, M7 (highest performance)
They define core functionalities and instruction sets across manufacturers.

## What optional functionalities do Cortex-M microcontrollers offer?
- **Memory Protection Unit (MPU)**: Segregates user and kernel modes, enhancing security.
- **SysTick Timer**: A standard timer for operating system tick generation.
- **Memory-mapped peripherals**: Access peripherals as if accessing memory.

## How is memory mapped in Cortex-M microcontrollers?
Cortex-M microcontrollers map code, peripherals, and system areas into specific memory regions. For instance:
- Code at 0x00000000
- SRAM at 0x20000000
- Peripherals at 0x40000000
Memory mapping simplifies addressing and control.

## What are the roles of core registers (r0-r15) in ARM architecture?
- **r0-r3**: General-purpose / argument passing
- **r13**: Stack Pointer
- **r14**: Link Register (function return address)
- **r15**: Program Counter (next instruction)
Core registers help manage function calls, local storage, and instruction flow.

## How do running modes work in MCUs?
- **User mode**: Restricted access; user applications run here for safety.
- **Kernel mode**: Full access to hardware, used by the operating system for critical operations like memory management, interrupts, or system calls.

## What is an Interrupt and how is it managed?
Interrupts are external or internal events that temporarily halt normal processing to execute specific service routines (ISR). The MCU uses an Interrupt Vector Table (IVT) to map IRQs to handlers, and interrupts can be prioritized if multiple occur simultaneously.

## What are the key costs to consider when designing embedded systems?
- **Energy**: Lower energy usage extends device lifespan, crucial for battery-powered IoT devices.
- **Money**: Cost optimization by using minimal but sufficient MCU capabilities to keep device prices competitive.

## How is the energy budget of an embedded IoT system calculated?
The energy consumption combines:
- **Sleep energy**: Low-power states during inactivity.
- **Active energy**: Processing and transmission.
- **Transition energy**: Waking from sleep states.
Reducing active time, batching operations, and optimizing wake-up strategies are crucial for long battery life.

## What are common techniques to optimize active state energy usage?
- **Parallelism**: Performing multiple tasks simultaneously during active periods.
- **Batching**: Grouping operations together to reduce frequent transitions between sleep and active states.
- **Minimizing clock rate**: Reducing the operating frequency when possible.

## What is Energy Harvesting in IoT?
Energy harvesting involves capturing ambient energy (solar, thermal, kinetic) to power IoT devices. It can either directly power nodes (harvest-use) or store energy in a battery for later use (harvest-store-use), extending lifetime without frequent maintenance.

## What are examples of ambient energy sources for harvesting?
- **Solar Energy**: Using photovoltaic cells to generate electricity.
- **Thermoelectric Energy**: Using temperature gradients (e.g., body heat).
- **Wind Energy**: Capturing kinetic energy through turbines.
- **Mechanical Vibration**: Piezoelectric materials converting movement into electricity.

## Why is battery technology a limitation in IoT devices?
Battery capacity growth is much slower compared to advances in microelectronics. Thus, reliance on traditional batteries limits IoT deployment, especially for remote or maintenance-intensive applications, pushing the need for energy harvesting solutions.

## What are Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and their relevance in IoT energy harvesting?
MDPs model decision-making where outcomes are partly random and partly under control. In energy harvesting systems, MDPs help optimize strategies like when to transmit data based on stochastic energy availability, balancing performance and energy sustainability.
