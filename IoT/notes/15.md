# IoT Security and Protocol Vulnerabilities

## What was the Mirai Botnet Attack and why was it significant in the IoT context?

The Mirai Botnet Attack, launched in August 2016, was a massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that targeted Dyn, a company critical to internet DNS infrastructure. It exploited insecure IoT devices like cameras and DVRs, using preinstalled usernames and passwords. These devices, once infected, formed a botnet controlled by a central command and control server. The attack generated traffic of up to 1.2 terabits per second, disabling major websites such as Twitter, Netflix, Reddit, and Airbnb, demonstrating the severe security vulnerabilities of IoT ecosystems.

## What are common vulnerabilities in the "Thing" layer of IoT architectures?

IoT devices face several key vulnerabilities at the "Thing" layer:
- **Node Capturing**: Physical access to replace or compromise nodes.
- **Malicious Code Injection**: Exploiting unencrypted firmware/software updates to insert harmful code.
- **False Data Injection**: Corrupt nodes feeding erroneous data to the system.
- **Eavesdropping and Interference**: Devices often operate in unsecured environments, making them vulnerable to data interception.
- **Sleep Deprivation Attack**: Battery-draining attacks that deny service to low-power devices.

## What are the security issues associated with the network layer in IoT?

The network layer of IoT is susceptible to:
- **DoS/DDoS Attacks**: Overwhelming servers with illegitimate requests to disrupt service.
- **Routing Attacks**: Including sinkhole (attracting traffic through fake routing advantages) and wormhole (using out-of-band links to bypass security) attacks. These compromise routing integrity and can lead to data loss or manipulation.

## How does a Man-in-the-Middle attack exploit MQTT in IoT?

MQTT, a publish-subscribe protocol, uses a broker to mediate communication. If an attacker gains control over the broker (the central communication point), they can:
- Intercept all published messages.
- Impersonate publishers or subscribers.
- Modify message contents.
This makes end-to-end encryption vital, but encryption must be decrypted and re-encrypted at the broker level, increasing the risk of data leaks.

## How does ZigBee ensure secure communication and what are its weaknesses?

ZigBee uses:
- **128-bit keys**, including Link Keys (unicast communication) and Network Keys (broadcast).
- **Trust Center** for authenticating new devices and distributing keys.
Key acquisition methods:
- Preinstallation
- Key Transport
- Key Establishment using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman

**Weaknesses**:
- Keys often transmitted unencrypted.
- Susceptible to sniffing attacks via USB dongles and sniffer software.
- Vulnerable to Sinkhole attacks where malicious nodes falsely advertise superior routes and intercept or alter data.

## What is the significance of Sinkhole attacks in ZigBee networks?

Sinkhole attacks are common in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). A compromised ZigBee node can:
- Advertise itself as having an optimal route to the base station.
- Divert traffic through itself.
- Drop or modify data stealthily.
These attacks are hard to detect and can disrupt the entire network’s reliability and trust.

## What vulnerabilities exist in BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) communication?

BLE is vulnerable to:
- **Unencrypted feature exchanges**: Allowing entropy downgrade (e.g., KNOB attack).
- **Address tracking**: Devices use static or rarely-changing addresses, making them trackable.
- **Frequent advertising**: Devices frequently send packets that can be sniffed to infer location and user behavior.

## How can BLE traffic be exploited for user identification?

BLE traffic, when sniffed:
- Reveals advertisement patterns.
- Allows for activity inference (e.g., walking, running based on packet frequency).
- Using regression models, attackers can correlate BLE traffic with accelerometer data to infer gait patterns and identify individuals.

## What are the main security flaws in LoRaWAN?

LoRaWAN security issues include:
- **Key Stream Reuse**: Reuse of AES-CTR key streams when the counter resets leads to ciphertext XOR leaks.
- **Frame Counter Vulnerabilities**: The counter used for encryption resets between sessions, allowing an attacker to collect ciphertexts and perform crib-dragging (guess plaintext segments).
- **Eavesdropping**: Intercepted packets can be manipulated if the attacker knows or guesses the plaintext.

## What is the KNOB attack in BLE, and how does it compromise security?

The KNOB (Key Negotiation of Bluetooth) attack exploits the fact that BLE’s pairing process is sometimes unencrypted. An attacker in the middle can:
- Force the devices to agree on a low-entropy (e.g., 7-byte) session key.
- Brute-force the key due to its weak entropy.
- Decrypt and forge session messages.

This is a classic example of a downgrade attack combined with a MitM setup.

## Why is end-to-end encryption in IoT difficult to maintain?

End-to-end encryption (E2EE) ensures that only communicating endpoints can read messages. However, in IoT:
- Protocol translators (e.g., gateways) need to decrypt messages to perform routing or format conversion.
- This breaks the E2EE chain.
- It increases exposure to attacks, especially if the gateway is compromised.

## How does 6LoWPAN support IPv6 in resource-constrained IoT networks?

6LoWPAN introduces an **adaptation layer** that enables IPv6 over low-power wireless networks:
- **Header Compression**: Reduces the 40-byte IPv6 header using shared contexts and inferred fields.
- **Fragmentation**: Splits large IPv6 packets to fit the 127-byte frame size of IEEE 802.15.4.
- **Mesh Routing**: Adds support for multi-hop transmission without full IP stack at each node.

This enables lightweight nodes to participate in IP-based communication.

## What are the dangers of not using proper key management in ZigBee and BLE?

Poor key management leads to:
- **ZigBee**: Shared network keys are often sniffed during transmission. Devices may reuse or expose keys over-the-air.
- **BLE**: Static or predictable addresses and unencrypted pairing expose keys to downgrade or replay attacks.

In both protocols, attackers can use sniffed keys to impersonate nodes or decrypt sensitive information.

## What are the key takeaways from fitness tracker BLE traffic sniffing studies?

Studies have shown:
- Fitness trackers advertise frequently and with minimal address obfuscation.
- BLE traffic patterns correlate strongly with user activity levels and movement.
- Attackers can passively collect data to track users or infer their behavior and identity.
- Most devices fail to implement basic privacy protections like randomized resolvable addresses.

This highlights the urgent need for stronger privacy mechanisms in wearable IoT devices.
