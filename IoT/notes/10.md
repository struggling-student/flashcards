# IoT Radio-Frequency Communication
## What is electromagnetic radiation and how is photon energy related to frequency?  
Electromagnetic (EM) radiation is energy that propagates through space as coupled electric and magnetic fields; the smallest indivisible packet of that energy is a **photon**. The energy of a single photon grows linearly with the wave’s frequency according to **E = h f**, where *h* is Planck’s constant (≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J s) and *f* is the frequency in hertz. Thus higher-frequency EM waves (e.g., X-rays) carry more energy per photon than lower-frequency waves (e.g., radio).  

## How are wavelength, frequency and the speed of light related?  
A wave’s **wavelength λ** (in metres) and **frequency f** (in hertz) are linked by the constant speed of light in vacuum, **c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m s⁻¹**, through the equation **c = λ f**. Consequently, long wavelengths imply low frequencies and vice-versa; doubling the frequency halves the wavelength.  

## Why are radio frequencies (3 kHz – 300 GHz) favoured for IoT wireless links?  
Radio waves are (a) comparatively easy and inexpensive to generate with electronic circuits, (b) able to propagate reliably through air over practical distances, and (c) non-ionising and therefore safe at typical IoT power levels. They also offer a vast, internationally regulated spectrum so that different protocols can coexist by occupying different channels.  

## Outline the functional blocks of an RF transmitter.  
1. **Modulator** – maps the digital message bits onto an analogue baseband waveform.  
2. **Up-converter/mixer** – shifts that waveform to the designated radio carrier frequency.  
3. **Power amplifier** – boosts the signal’s amplitude so that, after antenna radiation and path losses, sufficient power reaches the receiver.  
Together these stages convert 0s and 1s into a radiated EM field.  

## Why is up-conversion necessary instead of directly generating high-frequency digital signals?  
Direct high-frequency digital-to-analogue conversion demands ultra-fast, power-hungry DACs and transistors; up-conversion lets designers create the information waveform at a low, convenient frequency and then shift it to RF with comparatively simple, efficient analogue mixers.  

## State the Friis free-space transmission equation and its implications.  
In ideal free space the received power **Pᵣ** equals  
**Pᵣ = Pₜ Gₜ Gᵣ (λ / 4πr)²**,  
where *Pₜ* is transmitted power, *Gₜ* and *Gᵣ* are transmitter and receiver antenna gains, *λ* is wavelength and *r* is separation. Received power falls with the square of distance and (for fixed *r*) rises with higher antenna gain or longer wavelength.  

## List five major propagation-loss mechanisms and give one-line descriptions.  
* **Shadowing** – obstruction by large objects causing slow power fluctuations.  
* **Reflection** – specular bouncing from smooth surfaces (e.g., metal walls).  
* **Refraction** – bending as waves pass through media of different density.  
* **Scattering** – diffuse reflection from rough surfaces, sending energy in many directions.  
* **Diffraction** – bending round edges/obstacles, significant at lower frequencies.  

## What are Fresnel zones and why must at least the first zone be kept clear?  
Between a transmitter and receiver the first Fresnel zone is the ellipsoidal volume where path-length differences are ≤ ½ λ. Objects intruding into odd-numbered Fresnel zones cause destructive interference and extra loss; clearing 60 % of zone 1 (rule-of-thumb) ensures minimal additional attenuation.  

## Compare **omnidirectional** and **directional** antennas.  
*Omnidirectional* antennas (e.g., vertical dipoles, PCB traces) radiate equally in the horizontal plane, simplifying installation and serving moving or widely scattered nodes but offering lower gain and greater susceptibility to interference. *Directional* antennas (e.g., Yagi, parabolic) concentrate energy into narrow beams, yielding higher gain, longer reach and better interference rejection at the cost of precise aiming and larger physical size.  

## Define antenna **gain G** and give two equivalent formulas.  
Gain expresses how much an antenna focuses power relative to an ideal isotropic radiator:  
**G = η D = 4π Aₑ / λ²**,  
where η is radiation efficiency, *D* directivity, *Aₑ* effective aperture and λ wavelength. It is commonly quoted in decibels as **G(dBi) = 10 log₁₀ G**.  

## Explain how amplitude, frequency and phase modulation encode digital data, naming the binary variants.  
* **ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying)** – two amplitudes (high = 1, low = 0).  
* **FSK (Frequency Shift Keying)** – two distinct carrier frequencies for 1 and 0.  
* **PSK (Phase Shift Keying)** – carrier phase shifted (e.g., 0° for 1, 180° for 0 in BPSK).  
Each method maps bit values onto a physical parameter of the sinusoidal carrier. In higher-order schemes (e.g., QPSK, 16-QAM) multiple bits are represented by unique amplitude-phase *constellation* points.  

## How do **symbol rate** and **bit rate** differ?  
The **symbol rate** (baud) is the number of modulation symbols transmitted per second, whereas the **bit rate** (bit s⁻¹) equals the symbol rate multiplied by the number of bits encoded per symbol, *R_b = R_s · log₂ M*, where *M* is the constellation size. Increasing *M* boosts throughput but typically raises bit-error probability at a given SNR.  

## What is the purpose of a constellation diagram?  
It graphically depicts the permitted complex-baseband symbols of a modulation scheme: each point’s radial distance indicates amplitude and its angle indicates phase. Engineers use it to design constellations, visualise channel impairments (noise disperses points) and develop demodulation decision boundaries.  

## Describe the three principal MIMO techniques and their benefits.  
* **Spatial diversity** – transmits redundant copies of the signal via multiple antennas so at least one arrives with acceptable quality, improving reliability.  
* **Spatial multiplexing** – sends independent sub-streams simultaneously, raising throughput linearly with the minimum of transmit/receive antenna counts.  
* **Beamforming** – adjusts the phases/amplitudes across antenna arrays to constructively reinforce energy toward desired users or directions, enhancing SNR and reducing interference; enables multi-user MIMO.  

## Why can greater environmental attenuation sometimes increase network capacity in dense deployments?  
In offices filled with many access points, strong walls, furniture and higher-loss frequencies (e.g., 60 GHz) limit each AP’s coverage, reducing mutual interference so spatial reuse improves: more APs can operate on the same channel without collisions, raising aggregate throughput.  

## How does the vertex-colouring problem relate to Wi-Fi channel assignment?  
Model each access point (vertex) and any pair within interfering range (edge). Assigning non-overlapping RF channels corresponds to colouring vertices so adjacent ones differ. Minimising channel overlap equates to finding a legal colouring with fewest colours (chromatic number) or, in weighted graphs, minimising total interference—a classic NP-hard optimisation underpinning automated channel-planning tools.
