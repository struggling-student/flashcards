# IoT Architectures

## What are the main drivers and challenges that differentiate IT systems from IoT systems?

IoT systems differ from traditional IT systems in multiple aspects:
- **Data Focus**: IT supports business applications, while IoT focuses on sensor-generated data and its utilization.
- **Smart Devices**: IoT includes smart, data-producing devices beyond traditional computers.
- **Scale**: IoT networks involve massively more devices than IT networks, necessitating IPv6 for address space.
- **Security**: IoT devices, often exposed physically, have limited resources, making traditional IT security models insufficient.
- **Constrained Devices**: IoT devices have limited CPU, power, and memory; they transmit only essential data.
- **Data Characteristics**: IoT data is often unstructured and needs distributed analytics from edge to cloud.
- **Environmental Deployment**: Devices operate in diverse environments (hot, humid, underwater) requiring careful hardware selection.

## What are the layers of a typical IoT architecture?

An IoT architecture is commonly divided into three layers:
- **Sensor/Perception Layer**: Comprises sensors and actuators that collect and digitize environmental data.
- **Gateway/Network Layer**: Transfers sensor data using various wireless technologies, providing storage, processing, and security.
- **Application Layer**: Provides services to end-users by analyzing and interpreting collected data for monitoring, control, and decision-making.

## What classifications exist for smart devices in the Sensor Layer?

Smart devices can be classified based on:
- **Power Source**: Battery-powered (mobile, energy-limited) vs. power-connected.
- **Mobility**: Mobile (e.g., sensors on vehicles) vs. static (e.g., stationary weather sensors).
- **Reporting Frequency**: Low (e.g., daily reports) vs. high (e.g., hundreds of reports per second).
- **Data Richness**: Simple (single value) vs. rich (hundreds of parameters).
- **Sensing/Transmission Range**: The area a device can sense or transmit data to.

## How do devices communicate in the Network Layer through M2M communication?

Devices in IoT systems communicate autonomously using Machine-to-Machine (M2M) protocols:
- **M2M Networks Types**:
  - PAN (Personal Area Network): Few meters (Bluetooth).
  - HAN (Home Area Network): Tens of meters (ZigBee, BLE).
  - NAN (Neighborhood Area Network): Hundreds of meters.
  - FAN (Field Area Network): Outdoor areas larger than house clusters.
  - LAN and LPWA networks.
- **M2M Topologies**:
  - **Star Topology**: Devices connect to a central sink.
  - **Clustered Star**: Multiple sinks linked together.
  - **Mesh Topology**: Devices connect to multiple nodes creating redundancy.
  - **Hierarchical Tree**: Rooted at the sink with layered device connections.

## What is the role of gateways in IoT networks?

Gateways are essential for:
- Bridging sensor networks with the internet (especially when sensors can't run TCP/IP).
- Acting as edge servers to perform local processing, data filtering, and aggregation.
- Supporting a wide variety of protocols and enabling remote management.
- Differentiating from routers by providing protocol translation and edge computing capabilities.

## How is IoT application and analytics layer structured?

At this layer:
- **Applications** monitor and control IoT devices, generate reports, and support decision-making.
- Applications fall into two main categories:
  - **Analytics Applications**: Analyze and display system data.
  - **Control Applications**: Actively control devices based on complex logic or external data.
- **Analytics** includes:
  - **Data Analytics**: Combine multi-sensor data for intelligent insights.
  - **Network Analytics**: Monitor and optimize the connectivity and health of the IoT system.

## What is the difference between Edge, Fog, and Cloud Computing in IoT?

- **Edge Computing**:
  - Data is processed close to the source (sensor).
  - Reduces latency and internet bandwidth usage.
- **Fog Computing**:
  - Intermediate layer between Edge and Cloud.
  - Introduced by Cisco; provides more computing/storage closer to the Edge but still within LAN.
- **Cloud Computing**:
  - Centralized, powerful processing and storage.
  - High scalability but with higher latency.

## Why is Fog Computing necessary if Cloud Computing already exists?

Fog Computing helps by:
- Reducing the load on cloud servers.
- Optimizing network and computing resource utilization.
- Minimizing latency for real-time IoT applications.
- Reducing internet transport costs and enabling better use of cellular networks.

## What does "XaaS" stand for and what are the main cloud service models?

"XaaS" stands for "Everything as a Service", leveraging cloud platforms for flexible service delivery.
The three main models are:
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Access to virtualized computing resources.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Access to computing platforms for application development.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Access to fully managed applications.

## Who are the main cloud service providers supporting IoT?

Major cloud service providers include:
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Wide range of cloud services, hosting companies like Netflix, Airbnb, Uber.
- **Microsoft Azure**: Focuses on AI, Machine Learning, Blockchain, Analytics.
- Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI and supports running large AI models.

## What is an example of optimizing IoT task offloading in the Fog layer?

## Why is IPv6 critical for IoT scalability?

IPv6 is essential for IoT because:
- The number of IoT devices is exponentially larger than traditional IT devices.
- IPv4's 32-bit address space (~4.3 billion addresses) has already been exhausted.
- IPv6 provides a 128-bit address space, supporting up to 340 undecillion unique IP addresses, which is sufficient for assigning a unique address to every sensor and actuator on Earth.
- It supports **auto-configuration**, crucial for IoT systems with constrained devices that are deployed in dynamic environments.

## What is the impact of constrained devices on IoT network performance?

Constrained devices:
- Have **limited memory, power, and processing capabilities**, making them unsuitable for running heavy protocols like TCP/IP.
- Only transmit data when necessary to conserve energy and reduce bandwidth usage.
- Result in **lossy networks** that support **low data rates**, making traditional IT network protocols and assumptions (e.g., gigabit ethernet, reliable connectivity) inapplicable.
- Require lightweight protocols and optimized topologies to ensure reliability and energy efficiency.

## How does the physical deployment environment influence IoT hardware choices?

IoT devices must be tailored to their deployment context:
- Environments can vary drastically (e.g., **hot furnaces in a steel mill**, **underwater sensors**, **cold chain logistics**, or **high-vibration machinery**).
- Devices may need to withstand **humidity**, **kinetic vibrations**, or **corrosive substances**.
- Power source selection (battery vs. continuous) and durability become critical.
- Improper hardware choice leads to increased failure rates and maintenance costs.

## How do different M2M topologies affect reliability and power usage in IoT networks?

- **Star Topology**: Simple, with a single central node (sink), but if the sink fails, the network fails.
- **Clustered Star**: Adds redundancy via multiple sinks but requires more infrastructure.
- **Mesh Topology**: Highly reliable due to multi-hop redundancy, allowing data to reroute if one link fails. However, it consumes more power due to frequent communication.
- **Hierarchical Tree**: Efficient in structured environments, but a parent node failure can disrupt its subtree.
- **Trade-off**: More reliable topologies (e.g., mesh) often incur higher energy costs.

## In what scenarios is satellite communication necessary for IoT?

Satellite communication is needed when:
- Devices are deployed in **remote or isolated areas** with no terrestrial network infrastructure.
- Examples include **wildlife tracking**, **oceanic sensor buoys**, or **mountain monitoring stations**.
- It allows data to be sent over vast distances, but it is typically **high latency** and **expensive**, hence used sparingly or for critical data.

## What makes fog computing a middle ground between edge and cloud?

Fog computing bridges the gap by:
- Providing **more computing/storage** than edge nodes but closer to data sources than the cloud.
- Being **LAN-based**, allowing low latency responses suitable for **time-sensitive applications**.
- Handling tasks too complex for edge nodes but too latency-sensitive for cloud.
- Example: **Industrial control systems** using fog nodes to avoid latency delays that would be unacceptable in real-time automation.

## What specific features differentiate an IoT Gateway from a standard router?

IoT Gateways:
- Support **multiple protocols** (ZigBee, BLE, LoRaWAN, MQTT, CoAP), enabling integration of diverse devices.
- Include **edge computing capabilities**, such as data preprocessing and decision-making.
- Can **filter and aggregate data**, reducing load on the cloud.
- Provide **security features** like encryption, authentication, and access control.
- Example: MFX-1 gateway supports BLE, LTE, dual Ethernet, and embedded computing resources, unlike routers which mainly forward packets.

## What is the purpose of control applications in IoT systems?

Control applications:
- Govern the **behavior of devices** by executing logic too complex or resource-heavy for individual devices.
- Make decisions based on **aggregated sensor data** or external inputs.
- Example: A control app may analyze pressure sensor data to **adjust the speed of a pump** dynamically.
- They **offload decision logic** from constrained devices and enable centralized or semi-distributed control.

## How do data and network analytics differ in IoT systems?

- **Data Analytics**:
  - Combines data from multiple sources to generate **insights** or predictions.
  - Example: Integrating weather data from thousands of sensors to **predict storms**.
  - Can involve **AI, machine learning, or statistical models**.

- **Network Analytics**:
  - Focuses on the **health of the IoT network itself** (e.g., signal strength, packet loss).
  - Helps detect connectivity issues or anomalies like device failures.
  - Essential in **mission-critical systems** like autonomous vehicles or factories.

## What kind of optimization problem is the Fall Detection Offloading example, and why is it hard?

The Fall Detection task offloading is modeled as a **bin packing problem**, which is:
- **NP-complete**, meaning there's no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it for all cases.
- The goal is to assign tasks (with specific computational requirements) to fog nodes (with limited capacity) **while minimizing cost**.
- Constraints include:
  - All tasks must be assigned to some node.
  - No fog node can be overloaded.
  - Activating a node adds to cost, so fewer used nodes are better.
- Solving methods:
  - **Heuristics**, **approximation algorithms**, or **integer linear programming** tools like Gurobi.
