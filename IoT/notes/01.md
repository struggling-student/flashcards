# Internet of Things - Introduction

## What is IoT?
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the extension of internet services to everyday objects, enabling them to become part of a network by embedding sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers. First coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, IoT bridges Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), allowing for secure connectivity of servers and databases (IT) alongside supervision of industrial devices and processes (OT). Core elements are Sensors + Networks + Data + Services.

## What are Smart Objects in IoT systems?
Smart Objects are the building blocks of IoT systems. They must have the ability to sense, compute, and communicate. Through these capabilities, they transform isolated objects into interactive, data-producing entities. Components of smart objects include sensors, processing units, memory, actuators, communication units, and power sources.

## What are the main components of a Smart Object?
- **Sensors**: Capture and digitize environmental data.
- **Processing Unit**: Processes sensor data and issues control signals.
- **Memory**: Stores identifiers, properties, and sometimes sensed data.
- **Actuators**: Execute actions in the physical world based on processed data.
- **Communication Unit**: Enables data exchange with other devices or the internet.
- **Power Source**: Provides energy, can be batteries, solar, or main supply.

## Why did IoT become possible "today" and not earlier?
Three technological advancements enabled widespread IoT:
- **ARM Cortex-M Series (2004)**: Ultra-low power microcontrollers.
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE, 2006)**: Energy-efficient wireless communication.
- **6LoWPAN (2007)**: Enabled small devices to use the Internet protocol (IPv6) efficiently.

## What is 6LoWPAN?
6LoWPAN stands for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks. It defines header compression for IP packets, enabling small, resource-constrained devices to participate in IP networks while maintaining interoperability and flexibility across different link layers.

## What are the key characteristics of IoT systems?
- Heterogeneity: Variety of devices and protocols
- Massive Deployment: Billions of connected devices
- Interconnectivity: Devices communicating with each other and the internet
- Communication in Close Proximity: New protocols for local communications
- Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication
- Low-Power and Low-Cost Requirements
- Dynamic Network Changes: Sleep/wake modes, mobility
- Intelligence: Automated decision-making based on data

## What are the main challenges in IoT?
- Security and Privacy Vulnerabilities
- Data Overload and Management Complexity
- Interoperability and Lack of Standards
- Scalability of Networks
- Energy Efficiency and Battery Life
- Cost vs. Return on Investment (ROI)
- Latency and Reliability for Critical Applications
- Ethical and Legal Issues (e.g., data ownership, surveillance)
- Environmental Impact from device disposal

## What are the types of IoT "Internets" based on scale and environment?
- **Industrial Automation**: Thousands of devices per person, controlled environment, high reliability (e.g., WirelessHART).
- **Home Area Networks**: Hundreds of devices per person, uncontrolled environment, convenience-oriented (e.g., ZigBee).
- **Personal Area Networks**: Tens of devices per person, personal environment, focused on instrumentation and lifestyle (e.g., Bluetooth).

## What is the basic architecture of an IoT system?
An IoT system typically consists of three main layers:
- **Embedded Devices Layer**: Smart objects with local sensors and controllers.
- **Gateways Layer**: Devices that connect local smart objects to wider networks (e.g., via Wi-Fi, LTE).
- **Cloud Layer**: High-level data processing, storage, and application hosting.

## Why is Cloud and Mobile Integration important for IoT?
Thanks to technologies like BLE and 6LoWPAN, IoT devices can now interact directly with mobile devices and access cloud services, enabling remote monitoring, data analytics, and user notifications without requiring large infrastructure.
