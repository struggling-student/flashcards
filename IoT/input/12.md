# Mesh Networking in IoT (Lecture 5.3 ‚Äì PDF 12)

## What problems in typical IoT deployments motivate the use of mesh networking?

Mesh networking is introduced when a **large number of sensor/actuator nodes are scattered in places that lack reliable back-haul infrastructure** (e.g., forests, disaster areas, factories). Nodes must **co-operate autonomously to forward each other‚Äôs traffic**, coping with mobility, node failure and lossy links. The routing layer therefore has to handle **addressing, multi-hop forwarding, fault-tolerance and self-configuration** without relying on a fixed access point. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## How do proactive and reactive mesh-routing philosophies differ, and what trade-offs do they create?

* **Proactive (table-driven)** protocols (e.g., OLSR) attempt to *always* know a next hop to every other node.  
  * ‚úÖ Zero route-acquisition delay, good for periodic traffic and mostly static topologies.  
  * ‚ùå Costly periodic control floods, larger routing tables, exposes full topology (privacy + memory).

* **Reactive (on-demand)** protocols (e.g., DSR, AODV) build a route *only when needed*.  
  * ‚úÖ Lower overhead while the network is idle or traffic is sporadic; no global topology exposure.  
  * ‚ùå Higher initial latency (RREQ/RREP exchange), route cache can become stale, bursts of control when many flows start together. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## How does classical link-state routing operate in a wireless mesh, and why is it bandwidth-hungry?

Every router first discovers its 1-hop neighbours, then **floods ‚Äúlink-state advertisements‚Äù containing its neighbourhood**. After the floods converge, each node runs Dijkstra and stores the next hop per destination. Because flooding repeats whenever *any* link changes, **control traffic scales with `O(N‚ãÖE)` and wastes energy/bandwidth in battery-powered IoT nodes**. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## What is distance-vector routing, and what convergence problem can appear after failures?

Nodes exchange only their *current cost* to every destination with neighbours. Each router picks the neighbour that advertises the smallest cost as its next hop. After a break (link or node failure) **bad news propagates slowly (count-to-infinity)**‚Äîroutes may loop until progressively larger metrics ‚Äúpoison‚Äù the path. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## List four addressing schemes usable in mesh networks and give one advantage / drawback for each.

| Scheme | How addresses are assigned | üëç | üëé |
|--------|---------------------------|---|---|
| **Hardware / MAC** | Burned-in unique ID | No protocol overhead | Addresses may be long & non-topological. |
| **Geographic** | Coordinate (GPS, LIDAR map) | Natural for geo-routing | Needs location service; collisions at high precision. |
| **Hierarchical (tree)** | Parent subdivides its block (e.g., ZigBee C / R / L) | Easy aggregation & sparse routing tables | Re-numbering is hard when subtree grows unexpectedly. |
| **Stochastic** | Node picks a random ID, resolves conflicts | Zero pre-knowledge; plug-and-play | High probability of collision in large nets ‚áí extra handshake. | :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## How does ZigBee‚Äôs distributed addressing scheme allocate 16-bit addresses?

The PAN coordinator knows three design parameters: **maximum depth `L`, maximum children `C`, maximum router-children `R`**.  
* It keeps `S(d)` free address space per level (`d`) using the formula  
  `S(d)= C¬∑R^{L‚àíd‚àí1} ‚àí 1 ‚àí C + R` (for `R>1`).  
* A parent uses `A_par + S(d)¬∑(n‚àí1)+1` for its *n-th router child* and `A_par + S(d)¬∑R + l` for *l-th end-device*.  
This deterministic block allocation guarantees uniqueness without broadcasting yet preserves hierarchical aggregation. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## What is a Multipoint Relay (MPR) in OLSR and why is it crucial?

An **MPR is a neighbour elected by a node to retransmit its link-state floods**. Each node chooses the *smallest set* of neighbours that together cover *all* of its 2-hop neighbourhood. Because **only MPRs forward control packets**, OLSR slashes redundant rebroadcasts, shrinking energy use and contention. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

## Outline the heuristic OLSR uses to pick its MPR set.

1. Include every neighbour that is the *sole* path to some 2-hop node (covers isolated vertices).  
2. While uncovered 2-hop nodes remain, repeatedly add the neighbour that currently covers the *largest* number of still-uncovered 2-hop nodes.  
3. Stop when full 2-hop coverage is reached.  
The problem is NP-complete; this greedy algorithm offers near-minimal sets in practice. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

## Give two advantages and two downsides of OLSR in IoT meshes.

* **Pros**: Zero route delay; highly resilient thanks to redundant links; MPRs cut overhead relative to plain link-state.  
* **Cons**: MPRs drain batteries faster (role asymmetry); still maintains routes to *every* node‚Äîwasteful when traffic is sparse; periodic flooding can leak topology and consume channel in large nets. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

## Describe the three-phase route discovery in Dynamic Source Routing (DSR).

1. **RREQ flood** ‚Äì source broadcasts a Route Request, each hop appends its ID; duplicates suppressed via UID.  
2. **Reverse RREP** ‚Äì destination unicasts Route Reply back along the accumulated path (reverse list).  
3. **Source-route forwarding** ‚Äì the complete hop-list is written into every data packet.  
Routes are cached by all overhearing nodes; a **Route Error (RERR)** is sent back when any hop fails, pruning caches. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

## What triggers a Route Error in DSR and how is recovery performed?

If a node forwarding a source-routed packet cannot reach the *next hop* (link break or neighbour lost) it generates a **RERR** that is unicast back to the source along the packet‚Äôs already-traversed segment. Each intermediate node deletes cached entries that include the broken link; the source may use another cached path or start a fresh RREQ. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}

## How does AODV establish and maintain routes, and what role do sequence numbers play?

* **RREQ** floods outward, creating temporary reverse pointers.  
* Destination (or an intermediate node with a *fresh* route) unicasts **RREP** back; forward pointers created on the way.  
* Each route entry stores the destination‚Äôs **sequence number**, a monotonically-increasing tag issued by the destination itself. A node accepts a new advertisement only if the sequence number is *greater* (or same but with lower cost), preventing loops and the ‚Äúcount-to-infinity‚Äù problem.  
* **HELLO or link-layer feedback** detect breaks; **RERR** invalidates affected entries. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}

## Compare DSR and AODV for dynamic, memory-constrained IoT nodes.

| Aspect | **DSR** | **AODV** |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Routing info in **data** | Full hop-list in every packet ‚áí overhead grows with path length. | Only next hop kept in table ‚áí constant data header size. |
| Route caches | Aggressive caching; multiple paths, but risk of staleness. | Single best path; freshness enforced by sequence numbers. |
| Memory footprint | Small tables, but large packet headers. | Table proportional to active destinations; small packets. |
| Scalability / mobility | Performs well with moderate mobility & smaller nets. | Faster reconvergence in high-mobility, larger meshes due to seq. numbers. | :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}

## What is tree routing and when is it the preferred strategy?

Tree routing builds a **spanning-tree (often rooted at a sink or coordinator)** and forwards packets strictly along parent/child links. It is lightweight (each node stores only its parent) and suits **traffic patterns that are many-to-one or one-to-many** (e.g., sensor data collection to a gateway). However, single-path nature hurts reliability under failures and mobility. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}

## How does geographic (position-based) routing work in a mesh network?

Each node knows its own coordinates (GPS, anchor-based trilateration) and those of the destination. Packets are greedily forwarded to the neighbour **closest to the destination**; if stuck in a void, face-routing or perimeter-routing recovers. Geographic routing requires no per-destination tables but hinges on location accuracy and assumes obstacles are sparse. :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}

## What is the gossip algorithm and why is it attractive for massive IoT swarms?

In gossip (or epidemic) routing, a node **forwards a message to a randomly-selected subset of neighbours** with some probability `p`. Over time the message reaches most nodes with high probability while each device transmits only a few times, making gossip **simple, robust to mobility, and tunable (via `p`) to match energy budgets and desired reachability**. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}

## Why does increasing connectivity improve reliability yet raise power consumption?

Mesh topologies like **full or partial meshes create redundant links** so the network can reroute around failures (higher delivery ratio). But maintaining more links means **extra beaconing, larger tables or longer headers, and more radios kept awake**, directly raising energy usage‚Äîa critical trade-off in battery-operated IoT devices. :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}

## How and when is satellite communication integrated into an IoT mesh?

When sensors are deployed in **remote areas where even long-range terrestrial radios cannot bridge the gaps**, a local mesh collects data toward a **gateway equipped with a satellite transceiver**. The gateway appears as a ‚Äúsuper-sink‚Äù; the topology inside the mesh is still tree/mesh, but the final hop uses satellite to reach the cloud, sacrificing latency for coverage. :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}

## Which practical factors steer the choice between star, clustered-star, mesh and tree topologies in M2M IoT networks?

* **Device transmission range & density.**  
* **Failure tolerance goals** (mesh if single-point failure unacceptable).  
* **Energy budget** (star < tree < mesh).  
* **Traffic pattern** (periodic upstream ‚Üí tree/star; peer-to-peer ‚Üí mesh).  
* **Environment constraints** (obstacles may force multi-hop).  
* **Cost & complexity** (gateways, routing software, memory). :contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}

## What are the key takeaways for designing routing protocols in large, power-limited IoT meshes?

1. **Match routing philosophy to traffic pattern**‚Äîproactive for chatty/static networks; reactive for sparse or bursty traffic.  
2. **Conserve energy**‚Äîminimise floods (MPRs, caching), keep radios asleep, avoid long headers.  
3. **Exploit hierarchy or geography when available**‚Äîthey shrink state and simplify addressing.  
4. **Plan for dynamics**‚Äîuse sequence numbers, route-error feedback, or gossip to adapt quickly.  
5. **Balance reliability vs. cost**‚Äîredundancy (mesh) is valuable but must be justified by application criticality. :contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}
